Changelog for OpenSSH for Windows

9 July 2004
 - Updated to OpenSSH 3.8.1p1 and latest cygwin builds of other packages.

  KNOWN ISSUES (Anyone want to help pin these bugs down?):
  - Installing on Windows Server 2003 might or might not work
  - Windows Server 2003 is not currently supported, fixed installation procedures will be in a future release
  - Sometimes, the service doesn't want to start on Windows 2000 SP4. I have not been able to replicate.


15 October 2003
 - Removed chmod in installer - permissions were not working correctly
 - Moved back to cacls - see above

30 September 2003
 - Fixed bugs in installer
 - Added chmod for install support


22 September 2003
 - Updated to Cygwin1.dll v1.5.4
 - Moved to OpenSSH 3.7.1p1-1 because of security issues found in older versions

 KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Due to the quick need for this, and changes in NSIS, the installer has cosmetic issues
 - Some users have reported issues with Windows XP. I have tested this release
   with a default install with SP1 and have not had issues. I have not been able
   to test all configurations.
 - Using the included server with key-based authentication may not work unless
   you set StrictModes to off. It seems to be an issue with Windows file permissions.
   I am not considering this problem as a bug, but a solution is being investigated.
